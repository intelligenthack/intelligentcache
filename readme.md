# Distributed Cache

This package implements a distributed cache backed by Redis.

The cache has two levels. The first one is in memory and the second one is Redis.
When looking up a key, the memory cache is checked first. If the value is not found, redis is checked. The underlying data source is only consulted if the key is not found in any cache level.

## Configuration

Register the required services by calling the `AddRedisDistributedCache` method. This method has the following parameters:

| Name | Description
|-|-|
| `redisConnectionString` | The connection string to the Redis server, in the [format described here](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Configuration.html). |
| `exceptionLogger` | A callback that is called when an exception needs to be logged. We recommend using [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional), but you are free to use whatever you want. |
| `valueSerializer` | An optional parameter to customize the serialization of values to a Redis-compatible format. |
| `redisKeyPrefix` | A prefix that is appended to all keys that are stored on Redis. Defaults to "`cache:`". |

The following example shows a minimal configuration:

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRedisDistributedCache(
        "localhost:6379",
        ex => Console.Error.WriteLine(ex)
    );
}
```

## Usage

### Reading a value from the cache

There is a single operation to read from the cache and compute the value in case of a miss, called `GetSet`. It takes a cache key, a callback and a duration. If the cache contains a value for the specified key, that value is returned immediately. Otherwise, the callback is invoked to compute the value, which is then stored into the cache for the specified duration.

This design makes it so that in general, caching data is as simple as wrapping the existing code by a call to `GetSet`.

The following example shows how to get a value from the cache.

```c#
ICache cache = ...; // Get the cache from the DI container
string contentId = ...;
string cacheKey = "<some unique constructed key value, usually derived from contentId>";

var cachedValue = await cache.GetSet(cacheKey, async () =>
{
    // Read the value from the DB.
    // This callback will only be executed if the value was not found in the cache.
    using var sqlConnection = OpenConnection();
    return await sqlConnection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<string>(
        "select Value from Content where Id = @contentId",
        new { contentId }
    );
}, 10); // Keep in cache for 10 seconds
```

The `GetSet` method has multiple overloads to allow different representations of the same parameters, which can be summarized as follows.

| Name | Description
|-|-|
| `key` | The key used to lookup the value. This must uniquely identify the content and, in general, should be derived from the identifier of the value. |
| `calculateValue` | A callback that is invoked in case of a cache miss to calculate the value. |
| `duration` / `durationInSeconds` | How long the value should be kept in the cache. If this parameter is omitted, the item never expires. |
| `cancellationToken` | An optional `CancellationToken` to cancel the asynchronous operations. |

### Invalidating a value from the cache

When the source of cached data is modified, it may be desirable to invalidate the corresponding cache entry so that updated content is returned the next time it is requested. This is performed by calling the `Invalidate` method, as shown in the following example.

```c#
ICache cache = ...; // Get the cache from the DI container
string contentId = ...;
string newValue = ...;
string cacheKey = "<some unique constructed key value, usually derived from contentId>";

// Update the database
using var sqlConnection = OpenConnection();
await sqlConnection.ExecuteAsync(
    "update Content set Value = @newValue where Id = @contentId",
    new { newValue, contentId }
);

// Invalidate the cache
await cache.Invalidate(cacheKey);
```

The `Invalidate` method takes the following parameters:

| Name | Description
|-|-|
| `key` | The key that was used previously to lookup the value. |

# Architecture

A cache is a component that stores previously computed values for a period of time, so that the next time the value is needed, the computation can be avoided. The premise is that it is cheaper to look-up a value from the cache than computing that value.

This library implements a cache with multiple hierarchical levels. It means that whenever a lookup is performed, the first level is checked. If a value is found (hit), that value is returned and the second level is not contacted. If the value is not found in the first level (miss), the second level is checked ans so on, recursively. 

![A sequence diagram showing three interactions between the application and two cache levels. In the first one, the application requests a key which is found in the first level and returned immediately. In that case the second level isn't contacted at all. In the second interaction, the application requests a key which is not found on the first level, but is found on the second level. The value is stored in the first level and returned to the application. The last interaction shows the application requesting a key that is not found in either cache levels. A new value is then computed, which is stored into both levels.](doc/levels.drawio.svg)

Although the architecture supports an arbitrary number of levels, the predefined configuration is to have an in-process, in-memory cache as the first level, and a shared redis instance as the second level.

## Cache invalidation

The library implements a cache invalidation mechanism that can be used to force the cache to compute the value the next time it is requested. This is useful when the underlying data is modified and we want to make sure that the changes are immediately visible.
Cache invalidation requires synchronization between all the instances of the application, to ensure that their local memory cache is invalidated as well. This synchronization is implemented through Redis' pub/sub mechanism, by broadcasting an invalidation message to all instances.

## Consistency considerations

The cache makes no consistency guarantees. Two instances of the application might contain different values for a given key. The Redis level reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies since it serves as a shared source for all instances of the application. 

There are no consistency guarantees between different instances of the application. It is possible for two instances of the application to have different versions of the same data in cache, as illustrated in the following diagram.

![A temporal diagram that shows how different instances of the application can have an inconsistent view of the same data. Instance A requests a key which is found in the Redis level and stored in the in-memory level. Later, that value expires from Redis. When another instance of the application requests the same key, a new value is computed and stored in that instance's memory level. Until the old value expires from the first application instance's memory level, that instance still sees the old value.](doc/consistency.drawio.svg)

In order to minimize inconsistency window, after the Redis cache computes a value, it invalidates all other instances so that the inconsistency window is shortened. The following diagram shows this process.

![The same temporal diagram as before, with the difference that after the Redis level computes a new value, it invalidates the first application instance's cache, therefore reducing the time window during which the different instances are inconsistent.](doc/consistency-improved.drawio.svg)

# Requirements and best practices

## Values should be immutable

Once a value is cached, it should not be modified, since other instances of the application will not see the change. Either make the type immutable or be careful of not modifying it.

## Value serialization

In order to be able to store values on Redis, they need to be serialized. By default, values are serialized using [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json). Therefore you must make sure that all the values that are stored into the cache can be serialized in that way.

It is possible to customize the serialization by passing an implementation of `IRedisValueSerializer` to the `AddRedisDistributedCache` method.

Since values can be stored in Redis for a long period of time, it is important to be careful when changing type of the values that are cached. Any property that is added, modified or renamed may cause incomplete data to be retrieved. For example, consider the following code that retrieves content from a database and uses the cache to avoid hitting the database on every request:

```c#
public class Content
{
    public string Value { get; set; }
}
```

```c#
ICache cache = ...; // Get the cache from the DI container
string contentId = ...;
string cacheKey = $"content:{contentId}";

var content = await cache.GetSet(cacheKey, async () =>
{
    // Read the value from the DB.
    // This callback will only be executed if the value was not found in the cache.
    using var sqlConnection = OpenConnection();
    return await sqlConnection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<Content>(
        "select Value from Content where Id = @contentId",
        new { contentId }
    );
}, 10); // Keep in cache for 10 seconds

// Render a page containing the value of the content
```

Suppose that we later decide to add a timestamp to the content, so that we can show when the content was created. We could add a property to the `Content` class as follows:

```c#
public class Content
{
    public string Value { get; set; }
    public DateTime Creation { get; set; }
}
```

After making this change, any content that was previously cached on Redis will be incomplete, because it won't have a creation date. There are different ways to solve this problem. The simplest is to clear the Redis cache. The following command will delete everything with the `cache:` prefix:

```bash
redis-cli --scan --pattern "cache:*" | xargs redis-cli del
```

If clearing the cache is not desirable, there are other options. In some cases it is possible to assign a default value to the newly added property. Another option is to use a constructor to perform any needed validation. If the constructor throws an `ArgumentException`, it will be treated as a cache miss. The following code shows a possible implementation:

```c#
public class Content
{
    public Content(string Value, DateTime Creation)
    {
        Value = value;
        Creation = creation != default
            ? creation
            : throw new ArgumentException("Invalid creation date");
    }

    public string Value { get; }
    public DateTime Creation { get; }
}
```
